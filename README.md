# Recipies App

This project aims to make access to quick and simple (and tasty) recipies easier for all. 

It also happens to be my first attempt at a React-Native app!

## Project Highlights

* Created nearly 10 Functional Components and Class Based Components (whole views and single JSX Elements)
* Used animations to create a more pleasing UX
* Implemented navigation management using React-Native Navigation Stacks
* Integrated a Sqlite database for localised persistant data storage
* Wrote basic SQL queries to read and write data

## TODO

* Currently developing an API with a database from which the app will pull recipies from. Eventually, this will be integrated into an explore page.
